# Project-Euler-Solutions---Python
This repository consists of source code for my solutions (coded in python) of all problems published on Project Euler. My aim is merely to provide convenience to those starting out with python and promote new coders to persevere through the learning curve. I would still advise you to at least attempt solving the respective problems on your own to experience the serendipity that coders feel when they solve a problem. It's the best drug in the world and will keep you motivated and inspired to do more.
