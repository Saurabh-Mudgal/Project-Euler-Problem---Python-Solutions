# Project Euler Solutions - Python
This repository consists an exhaustive list of source codes of my solutions (coded in python) for problems published on Project Euler. My aim is merely to provide convenience to those starting out with python and promote new coders to persevere through the learning curve. I would still advise you to at least attempt solving the respective problems on your own to experience the serendipity that coders feel when they solve a problem. It's the best drug in the world and will keep you motivated and inspired to do more.


## Problem 1
### Multiples of 3 and 5

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.



## Problem 2
### Even Fibonacci numbers
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
